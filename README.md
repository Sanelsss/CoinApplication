This is the Application that uses API for displaying Coin information to an end user.You can search and see details related to desired coin. For this app I used core principles of object-oriented programming. I have used JavaScript and React concepts with CSS and HTML. For better functioning I used Typography library for better layout, multiple React Hooks,reactIcons and classes.
